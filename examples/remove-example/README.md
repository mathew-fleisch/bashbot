# Bashbot Example - Remove Example Command

In this example, a json example can be removed from a running configuration.

***Note: This will not work when the configuration json is mounted as a configmap. Use the seed method if bashbot is deployed in kubernetes to use this example***

## Bashbot Configuration

This command is triggered by sending `bashbot remove-example [command]` in a slack channel where Bashbot is also a member. There is no external script for this command and expects Bashbot's examples directory to exist. The valid arguments for this command come from the output of `bashbot list-examples` [list-examples read-me](../list-examples)
