## Bashbot configuration

This command is triggered by sending `bashbot latest-release` in a slack channel where Bashbot is also a member. This command requires no external script and simply returns a formatted message including links to Bashbot's source code and latest release.

```json
{
  "name": "Get Latest Bashbot Version",
