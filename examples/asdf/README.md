# Bashbot Example - List asdf Plugins

In this example, a few asdf commands are combined to display the installed versions for each of the pre-installed ([in container](../../.tool-versions)) asdf plugins.

## Bashbot Configuration

This command is triggered by sending `bashbot asdf` in a slack channel where Bashbot is also a member. There is no external script for this command, takes no arugments/parameters, and expects asdf and asdf plugins to already be installed on the host machine. The command first echos some title headers. Then it pipes the output of `asdf plugin list` to `xargs` in order to get the installed version for each plugin. It then uses `printf` (along with `awk` to remove leading spaces from `asdf list [ASDF-PLUGIN-NAME]` command) to print each asdf plugin name and its version, in a table format. Escaping single and double quotes in bashbot's json syntax can be difficult. 

```json
{
  "name": "List asdf plugins",
  "description": "List the installed asdf plugins and their versions",
  "envvars": [],
  "dependencies": ["asdf"],
  "help": "bashbot asdf",

    "&& echo \"│       asdf plugin │ version  │\"",
    "&& echo \"├───────────────────┼──────────┤\"",
    "&& asdf plugin list",
      "| xargs -I {} bash -c",
        "'printf \"│ %17s │ %-8s │\"",
        "\"{}\"",
        "\"$(asdf list {} | awk '\"'\"'{print $1}'\"'\"')\"",

    "&& echo \"•──────────────────────────────•\""
  ],
