BashBot is a slack bot written in golang for infrastructure/devops teams. A socket connection to slack provides bashbot with a stream of text from each channel it is invited to, and uses regular expressions to determine when to trigger bash commands. A [configuration file](sample-config.yaml) defines a list of commands that can be run in public and/or private channels. Restricting certain commands to private channels gives granular control, over which users can execute them. Bashbot allows infrastructure/devops teams to extend the tools and scripts they already use to manage their environments, into slack, that also acts as an execution log, and leverages slack's access controls.

See the [examples](examples) directory for more information about configuring and customizing Bashbot for your team.

See the [Setup/Deployment Examples Repository](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot-example) for more information about how to deploy Bashbot in your infrastructure. In this example, a user triggers a Jenkins job using Bashbot and another instance of Bashbot is deployed in a Jenkins job as a gating mechanism. The configuration for the secondary Bashbot could get info about the Jenkins job/host and provides controls to manually decide if the job should pass or fail, at a certain stage in the build. This method of deploying Bashbot gives basic Jenkins controls (trigger, pass, fail) to users in an organization, without giving them access to Jenkins itself. Bashbot commands can be restricted to private channels to limit access within slack.

## Installation and setup

Bashbot can be run as a go binary or as a container and requires a slack-bot-token, slack-app-token and a config.yaml. The go binary takes flags to set the slack-bot-token, slack-app-token and path to the config.yaml file and the container uses environment variables to trigger a go binary by [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh).

***Note about slack-bot-token and slack-app-token*

Bashbot uses the Slack API's "[Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket)" to connect to the slack servers over a socket connection and uses ***no webhooks/ingress*** to trigger commands. Bashbot "subscribes" to message and emoji events and determins if a command should be executed and what command should be executed by parsing the data in each event. To run Bashbot, you must have a "[Bot User OAuth Token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#bot)" and an "[App-Level Token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#app)".

- Click "Create New App" from the [Slack Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and follow the "From Scratch" prompts to give your instance of bashbot a unique name and a workspace for it to be installed in
- The "Basic Information" page gives controls to set a profile picture toward the bottom (make sure to save any changes)
- Enable "Socket Mode" from the "Socket Mode" page and add the default scopes `conversations.read` and note the "[App-Level Token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#app)" that is generated to save in the .env file as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`
- Enable events from the "Event Subscriptions" page and add the following bot event subscriptions and save changes
  - `app_mention`
  - `message.channels`
  - `message.groups`
  - `reaction_added`
  - `reaction_removed`
- From the "OAuth & Permissions" page, after setting the following "scopes" or permissions, install Bashbot in your workspace (this will require administrator approval of your slack workspace) and note the "[Bot User OAuth Token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#bot)" to save in the .env file as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
  - `app_mentions:read`
  - `channels:history`
  - `channels:read`
  - `chat:write`
  - `files:write`
  - `groups:history`
  - `groups:read`
  - `incoming-webhook`
  - `reactions:read`
  - `reactions:write`
  - `users:read`

Note: Prior to version 2, Bashbot required a "classic app" to be configured to get the correct type of token to connect to Slack. After logging into Slack via browser, visit [https://api.slack.com/apps?new_classic_app=1](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_classic_app=1) to set up a new "legacy bot user", "Bot User OAuth Access Token," add bashbot to your workspace, and invite to a channel. See the [Setup/Deployment Examples Repository](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot-example) for more detailed information about how to deploy Bashbot in your infrastructure.

***Steps To Prove It's Working***

- Now you should be able to run a few commands in your slack channel ...
- Create a new public channel in your slack called `#bot-test`
- Invite the BashBot into your channel by typing `@BashBot`
- Slackbot should respond with the message: `OK! I‚Äôve invited @BashBot to this channel.`
- Now type `bashbot help`
- If all is configured correctly, you should see BashBot respond immediately with `Processing command...` and momentarily post a full list of commands that are defined in config.yaml

## Automation (Build/Release)

Included in this repository two github actions are executed on git tags. The [![build-release](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot/actions/workflows/build-release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot/actions/workflows/build-release.yaml) action will build multiple go-binaries for each version (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, and darwin/arm64) and add them to a github release. The
[![Build containers](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot/actions/workflows/build-container.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot/actions/workflows/build-container.yaml) action will use the docker plugin, buildx, to build and push a container for amd64/arm64 to docker hub.

```bash
# example semver bump: v1.8.0
git tag v1.8.0
git push origin v1.8.0
```

There are also automated anchore container scans and codeql static analysis done on every push to the main branch.
